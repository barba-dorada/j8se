header = '{"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}'
HS256 indicates that this token is signed using HMAC-SHA256.

The payload contains the claims that we wish to make:

payload = '{"loggedInAs":"admin","iat":1422779638}'
As suggested in the JWT spec, we include a timestamp called iat, short for "issued at".

The signature is calculated by base64url encoding the header and payload and concatenating them with a period as a separator:

key           = 'secretkey'
unsignedToken = encodeBase64(header) + '.' + encodeBase64(payload)
signature     = HMAC-SHA256(key, unsignedToken)
To put it all together, we base64url encode the signature, and join together the three parts using periods:

token = encodeBase64(header) + '.' + encodeBase64(payload) + '.' + encodeBase64(signature)
